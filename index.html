        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a GIS and data professional with experience leading global geospatial projects,
          managing remote teams, and delivering high-quality mapping and analysis products.
          I hold a Master’s in Data Science and a Master’s in GIS, with an undergraduate
          background in Environmental Studies. My work blends geospatial analysis, field data
          collection, and software-supported workflows to turn complex spatial data into
          clear, actionable insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve managed international ground imagery programs, contributed to OpenStreetMap road
          networks, led solar farm suitability studies for utilities, and supported UI/UX
          improvements for internal imagery-viewing platforms. I enjoy building maps, stories,
          and tools that help people understand the world a little better and make better
          decisions about it.

          <h3>GIS Project Manager</h3>
          <p class="meta">Remote • 20XX – Present</p>
          <p>
            Directed a globally distributed team delivering ground imagery, geospatial analysis,
            and software-supported data products. Managed over 50 international field deployments,
            handling safety planning, logistics, and client expectations. Oversaw workflows
            using <strong>JOSM</strong>, <strong>QGIS</strong>, <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong>,
            and <strong>Mapillary</strong> to process, validate, and publish imagery and spatial edits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Served as the key liaison between clients and technical teams, translating requirements
            into development tasks and maintaining clear weekly and quarterly reporting. Managed a
            small software development team and guided UI/UX improvements for an internal imagery
            platform by providing user feedback, identifying workflow bottlenecks, and shaping
            feature priorities. Also led hiring, budgeting, scheduling, and team performance, and
            supported proposals through demos, web maps, and visual materials created in
            <strong>Canva</strong>.

          <h3>GIS Technician II – QC</h3>
          <p class="meta">Kaart • 2021 – 20XX</p>
          <p>
            Worked on the quality control team performing detailed review of team-produced
            geospatial edits using <strong>JOSM</strong>. Validated road network accuracy,
            corrected topology issues, and ensured all updates met client specifications and
            OpenStreetMap data standards. Trained and onboarded new team members in JOSM workflows,
            mapping best practices, and project requirements, supporting them until they became
            fully independent contributors.

          <h3>GIS Technician I</h3>
          <p class="meta">Kaart • 2019 – 2021</p>
          <p>
            Contributed to improving road and transportation infrastructure data within the
            <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong> platform, carefully editing features to enhance
            accuracy and completeness. Traveled internationally to collect street-level
            infrastructure imagery, supporting global mapping efforts and ensuring that
            ground-truth data informed edits. Assisted with, and at times led, client-requested
            projects using <strong>JOSM</strong> and <strong>QGIS</strong> to analyze datasets,
            refine map features, and deliver high-quality geospatial updates.
